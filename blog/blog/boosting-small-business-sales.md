In the competitive world of business, small companies often find it challenging to go head-to-head with larger firms, particularly in marketing and advertising. However, there’s a strategy that’s been helping level the playing field: giveaways.

Giveaways aren’t just about freebies. They’re a powerful tool that can boost customer base, amplify brand awareness, and cultivate customer loyalty. With a well-planned giveaway, small businesses can achieve their goals and see a significant improvement in their performance.

This article delves into the question: do giveaways increase sales for small businesses? We’ll explore the potential of giveaways to drive interactions, sales, and reach a wider audience. We’ll also share some unique giveaway ideas that can be tailored to your business needs. So, let’s dive in and discover how giveaways can be a game-changer for your small business.

## Do Giveaways Increase Sales: The Proof

It’s not uncommon for skeptics to question the effectiveness of giveaways in driving sales. However, **real-world data** suggests otherwise. Let’s examine a case in point: [SeedProd](https://www.seedprod.com/). This WordPress website builder used a giveaway strategy over the Black Friday holidays, offering entrants the chance to win a MacBook Air. The result? They saw a surge in new users, tallying over 4000. This translated to 3X their average sales, an impressive jump for any small business.

However, giveaways aren’t just about spurring immediate sales. They function as a potent component of your broader marketing strategy. Through tools like [CliquePrize](https://www.cliqueprize.com/), giveaways gather vital contestant data – or, lead data. They also spread brand awareness and fuel engagement. By proposing a giveaway, you’re essentially offering a free trial of sorts, inviting customers to consider your brand. Given the buzz they generate and their potential for viral, word-of-mouth marketing, giveaways can indeed catalyze sales in the long run.

Clever utilization of giveaways can, therefore, pave the way for both immediate and potential sales boosts. The same principle applies to ‘swag.’ This common term in business giveaways means promotional merchandise or branded items. As our current digital age loves free stuff, a strategic use of swag can effectively promote your brand, raise brand awareness, and cultivate customer loyalty. Thus, yes, giveaways can be an influential sales driver for small businesses.

## How Giveaways Can Boost Sales for Small Businesses

Giveaways do not merely benefit businesses by immediately increasing sales. This marketing tactic offers a wider range of benefits that can increase sales in the long run if leveraged correctly. Here are ten ways small businesses can use giveaways to enhance their bottom line.

### 1. Grow Your Email List
One key benefit of running a giveaway is bolstering your email list. But how does growing an email list translate to increased sales? Well, once you’ve collected the emails of your contestants, **you can execute a targeted email marketing campaign** towards this specific group. Considering that most people check their emails first thing in the morning, this technique has a high success rate.

[Raffle Leader's](https://raffleleader.com/) template “Grow Your Email List” can be utilized for this purpose, as it encourages contestants to opt-in for a chance to win. Once you have them on your list, it’s easier to nurture them through your marketing funnel and turn them into customers. For instance, you can email them with coupons and limited-time offers to pique their interest.

### 2. Increase Social Media Followers
Social media contests and giveaways have proven to be successful in gaining more followers. Businesses can earnestly build a community around their brands, increasing engagement and reaching potential customers who might not have been previously aware of the brand. For instance, campaigns like Glossier’s BoyBrowGrooming and Sephora’s SephoraSquad both encouraged followers to engage, resulting in a significant increase in their followers count.

### 3. More Social Engagement
With platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and LinkedIn offering avenues to share contests, more social engagement with your brand can be achieved. Users referred by familiar folks are more likely to participate in your contests. This helps to **encourage a sense of community around your brand**.

### 4. Boost Website Traffic
The more people interact with your giveaways through various channels, the more traffic is driven to your website. This engagement then increases the chances for these visits to convert to sales, thereby benefiting your overall bottom line.

### 5. Easy Retargeting
By completing the contest entry actions, contestants provide helpful user data that facilitates retargeting campaigns. Tools like CliquePrize aid businesses to capture this lead data, creating a directory where these contestants can find your small business easily.

### 6. Improve Product Exposure
Giveaways are similar to free trials. Offering a chance to win your product introduces it to potential customers, leading to product exposure and potential long-term loyalty.

### 7. Collect User-Generated Content
Giveaways also provide an opportunity for collecting User-Generated Content. This improves your brand exposure, as enthusiastic participants will likely post and share about the giveaways on different platforms.

### 8. Gather Helpful Feedback
Some often overlook the benefit of consumer feedback, which can be derived from contests and giveaways. This helpful information allows for adjustments and improvements, leading to better products and service.

### 9. Increase Word-of-Mouth Marketing
Nothing beats the good old-fashioned word-of-mouth marketing. Running a successful giveaway encourages happy participants to spread the word about your business, thereby reaching a larger audience.

### 10. Save Time and Money
Compared to other marketing methods, running giveaways is cost-efficient. Not only do they increase exposure rapidly, but they also require minimal resources.

It’s noteworthy to mention that giveaways offer an exciting opportunity to reel customers in, and they are more likely to stay and shop your products when this strategy is employed. Following these strategies judiciously can significantly impact your small business positively.

### The Potential Downsides of Giveaways
While the impact of giveaways on a small business’s bottom line can be compelling, some potential downsides should be considered before diving headfirst into this strategy. Giveaways carry the risk of attracting individuals who are only interested in freebies. Some entrants might have no genuine interest in the product, service or even the brand. They’re simply out for what they can get for free, which does little to further the business’s objectives.

**Use of resources** is another aspect that needs a careful eye. Conducting a giveaway requires an investment – there’s the cost of the ‘prize’, time spent planning and promoting the event, and even potential legal considerations.

In light of these factors, it’s important to find a balance and ensure giveaways are not draining more resources than they’re worth. A properly planned and executed giveaway can offer great returns.

Don’t get discouraged. Challenges are part of any marketing strategy, and giveaways are no different. Understanding these potential pitfalls can help guide a more effective and efficient approach to this exciting promotion technique.

<!-- This thought of being able to build my own side-project that could generate profit while I slept was always attractive to me.

So I’m happy to report that I’ve finally done it with my first software-as-a-service (SaaS) app, [CoverLetterGPT.xyz](http://CoverLetterGPT.xyz), which I launched in March 2023!

I’ll be the first to admit that the results aren’t spectacular, but they’re still something I’m very proud of: 

- over 5,000 registered users
- $203 monthly recurring revenue (MRR)

Below, I’m going to share with you how I built it (yes, it’s [open-source](https://github.com/vincanger/coverlettergpt)!), how I marketed and monetized it, along with a bunch of helpful resources to help you build your own profitable side-project.

## What the heck is CoverLetterGPT?

[CoverLetterGPT.xyz](http://CoverLetterGPT.xyz) was an idea I got after the OpenAI API was released. It’s an app that allows you to upload a PDF of your CV/resumé, along with the job description you’re applying to, and it will generate and edit unique cover letters for you based on this information.

{% embed https://youtu.be/ZhcFRD9cVrI %}

It also lets you save and manage your cover letters per each job, making it easy to make and apply to multiple jobs without having to keep copy and pasting all your important info into ChatGPT! 

## What’s the Tech Stack?

![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xpb97bgrx98bwxemrg0o.png)

CoverLetterGPT is entirely open-source, so you can [check out the code](https://github.com/vincanger/coverlettergpt), fork it, learn from it, make your own, submit a PR (I’d love you forever if you did 🙂)… whatever!

I built it using the [Wasp full-stack framework](https://wasp-lang.dev) which allowed me to ship it about 10x faster. 

Why? 

Because [Wasp](https://wasp-lang.dev) as a framework allows you to describe your app’s core features in a `main.wasp` config file. Then it continually compiles and “glues” these features into a React-ExpressJS-Prisma full-stack app for you. 

All you have to focus on is writing the client and server-side logic, and Wasp will do the boring stuff for you, like authentication & authorization, server config, email sending, and cron jobs. 

BTW, [Wasp](https://wasp-lang.dev) is open-source and free and you can help the project out a ton by starring the repo on GitHub: [https://www.github.com/wasp-lang/wasp](https://www.github.com/wasp-lang/wasp) 🙏

{% cta [https://www.github.com/wasp-lang/wasp](https://www.github.com/wasp-lang/wasp) %} ⭐️ Thanks For Your Support 🙏  {% endcta %}

For the UI, I used [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/), as I always do. I like that it’s a component-based UI library. This helps me build UI’s a lot faster than I would with Tailwind or vanilla CSS.

For payments, I used [Stripe](https://www.notion.so/How-I-Built-and-Open-Sourced-CoverLetterGPT-5-000-users-200-MRR-0d32f13fa00a440fb8e08c8dbf2b8a27?pvs=21), (I’ll go into the details of monetization below). 

The Server and Postgres Database are hosted on [https://railway.app](https://railway.app/), with the client on [Netlify.com](http://Netlify.com)’s free tier.

By the way, If you’re interested in building your own SaaS with almost the same stack as above, I also built a [free SaaS template](https://github.com/wasp-lang/SaaS-Template-GPT) you can use that will save you days of work!  

## How I Marketed It

My biggest take-away from this whole project was that open-sourcing it was the best way to market it!

This seems counter-intuitive, right? Why would making the code available for anyone to see and copy be good for a business? You’re basically rolling out a red carpet for competitors, aren’t you?

Well, not quite.

First of all, the number of people who will realistically spend the time and energy launching a direct competitor is low. Also, most people interested in your open-source code want to learn some aspect of it and apply it to their own ideas, not just copy yours directly.

Secondly, and most importantly, the fact that it’s open-source makes people a lot more receptive to you talking about it. 

![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/q79djej6doj2yq10l2og.png)

When you present something you’ve built and give people the opportunity to learn from it, they’re much more welcoming! As a result, they’re more likely to upvote it, share it, use it, and recommend it to others.

This is exactly what happened with CoverLetterGPT! As a result of me sharing the open-source code, it get featured on the [IndieHackers.com](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/whats-new-don-t-build-things-no-one-wants-833ee752ba?utm_source=indie-hackers-emails&utm_campaign=ih-newsletter&utm_medium=email) newsletter (>100k subscribers), shared on blogs, and talked about on social media platforms.

![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/44rlv65u97qhufbhqt0k.png)

And even though it’s a small, simple product, I tried launching it on [Product Hunt](http://producthunt.com), where it also performed considerably well.

So, all together, these initial efforts combined gave my product a good initial marketing presence. To this day, I haven’t really done much else to market it, except some twitter posts (and this post, if you want to consider it marketing 🤑).

## How I Monetized It

When I first launched in March 2023, I didn’t really expect anyone to pay for the product, but I wanted to learn how to use Stripe as a payments processor, thinking that the skills might be useful in the future.

So I started simple, and just put a one-time payment link for tips. No paywall, no subscriptions. It was entirely free to use with any tip amount welcome.

To my surprise, tips started coming in, with some as high as $10 dollars!

This encouraged me to force users to login to use the product, and add a paywall after users used up 3 credits.

My initial payment options were:

- $4.95 for a 3 months access
- $2.95 for 10 cover letter generations

![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/golo3tnh3o0sy5sujrer.png)

That went reasonably well until I implemented the ability for users to use GPT to make finer edits to their generated cover letters. That’s when I changed my pricing and that’s when better profits started to come in:

- $5.95 / month subscription with GPT-4
- $2.95 / month subscription with GPT-3.5-turbo

Currently, over 90% of my customers choose the more powerful, more [expensive plan with GPT-4](https://openai.com/pricing), even though the 3 trial credits use the GPT-3.5-turbo model.

(I also integrated Bitcoin Lightning payments — check out the [repo](https://github.com/vincanger/coverlettergpt) if you want to learn how — but haven’t received any yet.)

Now, with an MRR of ~$203, my monthly profit of course depends on my costs, which are:

- Domain Name: $10/year
- OpenAI bill: ~ $15/month
- Hosting bill: ~ $3/month

Which leaves me at about ~ $183/month in profits 😀

## Future Plans

One of the most surprising aspects about [CoverLetterGPT.xyz](http://CoverLetterGPT.xyz)’s success is that, on the surface, the product is very simple. Also, I’ve done very little in the way of SEO marketing, and haven’t continued to market it much at all. The current growth is mostly organic at this point thanks to my initial marketing efforts.

But I still have some plans to make it better:

- buy a better top-level domain (TLD), like [CoverLetterGPT.ai](http://CoverLetterGPT.ai)
- add more features, like the ability to generate interview questions based on the cover letters
- improve the UX and make it look more “professional”

If you have any other ideas how I could improve it, drop me a comment, message me on [twitter/x](https://twitter.com/hot_town), or submit a [PR to the repo](https://github.com/vincanger/coverlettergpt).
