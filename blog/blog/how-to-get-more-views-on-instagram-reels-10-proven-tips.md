Short-form videos have revolutionized video creation, becoming a powerful tool for engaging audiences on social media and beyond. With a whopping [2 billion monthly active users](https://www.statista.com/topics/1882/instagram/), Instagram remains a key platform for marketers and creators—with its Reels feature becoming the go-to for creating engaging short-form content and [achieving viral success](https://raffleleader.com/blog/social-media-viral-marketing-examples-content-strategies/). But how exactly do you get more views on your Instagram Reels? In this article, we’ll walk you through effective strategies and hacks guaranteed to boost your reel visibility and engagement. But first…

## **What Are Instagram Reels?**

Instagram Reels lets you create short videos that captivate and entertain your audience. Introduced in response to platforms like TikTok, Reels allows you to share 15-to 60-second videos with music or trending sound bites, using creative editing tools and effects to enhance your content. Keep in mind that views are only counted if [viewers watch for at least three seconds](https://help.instagram.com/1562166204102854). Also, Instagram only counts the initial views from each user, meaning you can't repeatedly watch your reel with the same account. Make sure your first four seconds are engaging to hook your audience and ensure your views count.

## **Why Do Views Matter on Instagram Reels?**

Simply put, getting more views on your Instagram Reels boosts your online presence. As more people watch and engage with your content, it becomes more shareable, which can help you attract more followers and grow your profile. Higher view counts can also draw in potential customers, increase your chances of [going viral](https://raffleleader.com/blog/how-to-go-viral-on-instagram-5-proven-tips-and-tricks/), and lead to monetization opportunities. Instagram Reels consistently outperform carousels, single photos, stories, and feed videos across various metrics, making them Instagram’s fastest-growing feature. By integrating Reels into your Instagram marketing strategy, you can capitalize on this trend to increase engagement and enhance your brand's visibility.

## **Best Tips to Get More Views on Instagram Reels**

### **1\. Lead with a Strong Hook**

![](https://raffleleader-blog.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/stronghook.png) As mentioned, a view needs at least three seconds of attention to count. Grab viewers’ attention immediately by jumping straight into the action and avoiding long intros. Start with a hook to pique curiosity or spark interest immediately, which could be through striking images or thought-provoking questions that compel viewers to learn more.  When sharing a transformation or process, you can showcase the result first to build curiosity and keep viewers watching. Short and impactful content is key on Instagram, so communicate your message quickly before users feel compelled to scroll away. Plan your Reel to lead with a strong hook, whether it's something you say, a special effect, a facial expression, text, or a thumbnail image. The first few seconds are crucial for maintaining viewer interest, so make them count. For thumbnail images, choose one that matches your aesthetic, similar to what user [@itsmodernmillie](https://www.instagram.com/itsmodernmillie/?hl=en) did in the example above. Consider adding text or a quote to give viewers a preview of your content. A well-designed thumbnail can entice viewers to click and watch your Reel, ensuring your message reaches a broader audience.

### **2\. Create High-Quality Content**

Instagram is a visually-driven platform, so optimize your Reels with high-quality videos in the 9:16 aspect ratio. Pay attention to lighting, framing, and composition to keep your key messages or subjects centered. Use natural light whenever possible, or invest in professional lighting equipment to ensure your content is well-lit and visually appealing.  High-quality visuals grab attention, making viewers more likely to stop, watch, and engage with your content. A visually stunning Reel enhances your credibility and attracts more views, as Instagram’s algorithm favors good-looking content.

### **3\. Use Captions and Text Overlays**

![](https://raffleleader-blog.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/textoverlays.png) Google’s [search engine optimization](https://raffleleader.com/blog/technical-seo-audit-5-step-guide-for-2024/) (SEO) relies heavily on high-quality content. The same applies to Instagram, including your captions. Your captions should include relevant keywords that help the algorithm understand your content. Start your caption with the main focus, tell a story, and use emojis to add personality that matches your brand voice. Use bullet points and line breaks to keep it readable, and always include a call-to-action (CTA) to guide your audience. Text overlays can also highlight key points and provide extra context or information. Since many users watch Instagram videos without sound, text overlays ensure your content is accessible and engaging even when viewed silently. Adding captions and text overlays is a simple yet effective strategy to make your content more engaging and attract more views. Choose readable fonts and ensure text is large enough for small screens, keeping it short and avoiding coverage of important visuals.

### **4\. Use Popular or Trending Sounds**

![](https://raffleleader-blog.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/trendingsounds.webp) Using trending sounds can significantly boost your Reels' exposure, as they’re more likely to appear in the Explore tab. When you use popular audio, it signals to Instagram that your video should be shared with users who like that sound.  With Instagram's vast music library, it’s easy to find the perfect audio—just use the search bar to explore trending songs. Remember, you don't need music if your Reel is dialogue-based. To see what's trending, tap on the music of any Reel to view how many creators have used it. The right music can truly make the difference between a video going viral or being overlooked. 

### **5\. Engage with Similar Content**

Instagram's algorithm learns from your interactions to deliver content that's aligned with your interests. By engaging with posts and Reels you like, you encourage Instagram to show you more of the same. This keeps you inspired and helps ensure your content reaches the right audience. Additionally, partnering with influencers and fellow Instagram users can significantly enhance your Reels' visibility—[Meta highly recommends it](https://www.facebook.com/business/news/build-connected-brand-with-reels), too! Collaborate on viral challenges or joint content to reach new audiences. When selecting influencers, prioritize those with engaged followers who match your target demographic. 

### **6\. Embed Reels on Your Website or Blog**

Cross-promoting your Instagram Reels on your website is another effective way to broaden your audience and get more views. By embedding Reels on your website or blog, you introduce your content to visitors who may not yet follow you on Instagram. This approach enhances the engagement of your website and encourages visitors to interact with your content. For example, if you're [running a giveaway on Instagram](https://raffleleader.com/blog/how-to-run-a-instagram-giveaway/), embedding your Reel on your website creates a seamless experience. Visitors can watch the video, learn about the giveaway, and participate in one place. Integrating your Reels into your website expands your reach, strengthening your online presence to attract more followers and viewers.

### **7\. Create Short Reels**

![](https://raffleleader-blog.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/shortreels.webp) Did you know that the average attention span is only about eight seconds? Like [TikTok videos](https://raffleleader.com/blog/how-to-go-viral-on-tiktok-5-proven-strategies-for-success/), viewers on Instagram Reels are less likely to watch if the video exceeds eight to ten seconds.  To capture their attention, start with an intriguing story, an interesting fact, or something that initially sparks curiosity. Keeping your Instagram Reels under ten seconds ensures viewers are more likely to watch the entire video, especially when you include a compelling hook at the start. For instance, take Cinnabon's Instagram Reel—it got over 800,000 views because it was under 10 seconds and had a relatable hook. Creating short and engaging Reels boosts views and watch time and keeps your followers engaged with high-quality content.

### **8\. Post Regularly at Peak Times**

Consistency is key to maintaining visibility on Instagram. Even if [your content goes viral](https://raffleleader.com/blog/viral-content-marketing-strategies-for-2024/), staying active on the platform ensures your audience remembers you. The Instagram algorithm favors accounts that post regularly, increasing the chances of your content being discovered through searches. Moreover, regular posting keeps your followers interested and gives them a deeper understanding of your brand. To maximize engagement, post your Reels when your audience is most active. Use tools like [Instagram Insights](https://help.instagram.com/788388387972460) to identify optimal posting times tailored to your data. Scheduling your Reels during peak activity periods enhances the chances of immediate engagement and visibility. This strategic approach increases views and makes your content more likely to appear on Instagram's Explore page, reaching a broader audience.

### **9\. Organize Contests or Giveaways**

![](https://raffleleader-blog.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/reelgiveaway.webp) Contests or giveaways are proven methods for increasing video views. [Offer a prize](https://raffleleader.com/blog/178-giveaway-prize-ideas-to-captivate-any-audience/) for simple actions like following your account and tagging a friend. The more followers you have, the higher your chances of getting more views on your Reels.

### **10\. Use Relevant Hashtags**

![](https://raffleleader-blog.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/hashtags.webp) Boost your Reel views by [using relevant hashtags](https://raffleleader.com/blog/2024s-top-instagram-giveaway-hashtags-to-boost-engagement/). Including hashtags increases the likelihood of more users discovering and watching your Instagram video. Remember to limit your hashtags to a maximum of ten to avoid being flagged as spam by Instagram’s algorithm. To find trending hashtags, use Instagram’s search feature to analyze hashtag usage and popularity.  For maximum impact, mix popular hashtags with niche-specific ones and avoid generic hashtags. Experiment with different combinations to see what works best for your content. Creating a branded hashtag is also an excellent way to enhance brand awareness. Make it short, memorable, and relevant to your brand. Then, promote your branded hashtag across all your social media channels and encourage followers to use it when sharing content related to your brand.  You can even incorporate it into contests and giveaways as an entry requirement for added engagement. Sharing user-generated content collected through a [photo caption contest](https://raffleleader.com/blog/10-creative-caption-contest-ideas-examples/) using your branded hashtag is another way to use it as part of your social media strategy.  For example, with Raffle Leader’s [refer-a-friend feature](https://raffleleader.com/blog/10-best-refer-a-friend-promotion-ideas-to-grow-your-business/), you can require users to write a message to enter your contest or giveaway, boosting participation and visibility.
