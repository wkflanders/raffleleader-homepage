Running a successful giveaway requires planning everything from choosing the prize and setting entry requirements to building a landing page and planning how you'll promote it. However, one crucial step that's equally important but often overlooked is announcing and communicating with the giveaway winners. After all, what's the point of organizing a giveaway if it isn't clear who the winner is at the end?

In this article, we’ll explore various ways to announce a giveaway winner, complete with examples for inspiration.

## **5 Ways to Make a Giveaway Winner Announcement**

### **1. Notify the Winner by Email**

Personalized emails are a popular and effective way to notify and congratulate giveaway winners. They allow you to connect directly, share a thoughtful message, and receive a prompt response. Additionally, emails allow winners to share their addresses for prize delivery privately. Before making a public announcement, it's crucial to notify the winner by email first. This ensures they meet eligibility requirements, permits you to use their name in the announcement, and confirms they’ll claim the prize. Allow three to seven days for a response; if they don’t reply within this timeframe, choose another winner and inform the original one via email. If you’re [hosting a giveaway on Facebook](https://raffleleader.com/blog/step-by-step-guide-to-running-a-successful-facebook-giveaway/), this step ensures you comply with their rules, which require notifying winners privately before making any public announcement.

![](https://raffleleader-blog.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/20240717015853-bb9657bc.png.webp) Blog posts offer the most flexibility compared to other announcement channels because they offer ample space to include various types of content. You can use this platform to vividly illustrate the stages of your giveaway from beginning to end, incorporating visual elements such as photos and videos. Additionally, publishing a blog post generates new content for your website, which provides [valuable SEO benefits](https://raffleleader.com/blog/technical-seo-audit-5-step-guide-for-2024/).

*   **Acknowledgment**: Thank all participants for their time and enthusiasm throughout the contest.
*   **Winner announcement**: Boldly reveal the winner's name (with their permission) and describe their prize.
*   **Contest recap**: Highlight interesting statistics such as entry numbers, participant demographics, or notable trends.
*   **Visuals**: Enhance your blog post with relevant images, such as prize photos or contest entries, to make it visually engaging and shareable.
*   **Future promotions**: Conclude by teasing upcoming contests or promotions to keep your audience excited and engaged.

This structure ensures your blog post informs, captivates, and prepares your audience for future interactions. **Example of a Blog Post Announcement** _Blog post title: Announcing the Winner of our Raffle Leader Summer Giveaway!_ _Blog post:_ _We've just concluded our Summer Giveaway, and it's time to announce our lucky winner!

### **5. Send an Email to Non-Winners**

**![](https://raffleleader-blog.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/emailtononwinners.png.webp)** Once your giveaway winner has responded to claim their prize and given permission to publish their name, you should email contest participants who didn’t win. Initially, they may feel disappointed, so this email is a chance to offer a consolation prize and keep them engaged.  Send them an email to show gratitude for helping make your giveaway a success. Show sincerity by offering a special discount, promo code, or free ebook copy. Anything is effective as long as it’s relevant and valuable to your target audience! Lastly, let them know that while they didn’t win this time, more opportunities to win will be coming their way soon.

#### **Example of a Thoughtful Email to Non-Winners**

_Subject line: Your Reward for Entering Raffle Leader’s Summer Giveaway_ _Email message:_ _Hi (participant’s name),_ _Thank you for participating in our Summer Giveaway and contributing to its success._ _Unfortunately, you weren't selected as a winner this time.
