As the world's [fifth most popular social media platform](https://www.demandsage.com/tiktok-user-statistics/), navigating the competitive world of TikTok can feel overwhelming. With its immense popularity and rising number of content creators, standing out can seem impossible. But TikTok offers incredible opportunities to increase followers, boost engagement, and attract high-quality leads. What if you could tap into this potential without a big budget? Promoting your TikTok videos effectively and for free is possible and can significantly impact your success on the platform. In this article, we’ve gathered ten tips for promoting your TikTok videos and [making your content go viral](https://raffleleader.com/blog/how-to-go-viral-on-tiktok-5-proven-strategies-for-success/) without spending a dime.  But first… 

## What is the TikTok Promote Tool?

[TikTok Promote](https://support.tiktok.com/en/using-tiktok/growing-your-audience/use-promote-to-grow-your-tiktok-audience) is an advertising tool within the TikTok app that lets you turn regular videos into ads. To quickly launch your campaign, simply choose your audience, set your budget, and determine your ad duration. Promote enhances your views, drives traffic to your website, and boosts your follower count, improving your visibility and engagement on TikTok. Additionally, Promote provides detailed metrics to track your video’s performance, including views, likes, comments, and shares. You can also monitor website visits and demographic insights, such as the age and gender of your audience interacting with the video. But before you dive into Promote, note that there are a few restrictions on the types of videos you can promote, namely:

*   Promote campaigns are only available for public videos on TikTok.
*   You can only use Promote with original sounds or sounds from TikTok’s commercial music library.
*   Videos may be rejected from Promote if they violate TikTok’s community guidelines.

Now, on to the big question:

## Is TikTok Promote worth the cost?

Paying for TikTok video promotion has its advantages and disadvantages. If you're having trouble breaking into the For You Page (FYP) and gaining exposure, investing in ads can increase your video’s visibility, resulting in more views and engagement. However, it's crucial to weigh whether the cost [aligns with your brand](https://raffleleader.com/blog/brand-alignment-6-tips-to-boost-lead-generation/), business goals, and target audience. TikTok Promote campaigns can range from $3 to $1,000 per day and run from one to seven days. While paying for video promotion can boost visibility, it can be costly and might not always be the most efficient way to reach your target audience. Additionally, TikTok’s algorithm tends to prioritize content that performs well organically. Focusing on creating high-quality, engaging videos and maximizing free marketing strategies is often a more sustainable and cost-effective approach.
