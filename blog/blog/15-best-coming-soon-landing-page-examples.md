Are you planning to launch something new? Integrating a coming soon page into your website is a smart tactic to drum up excitement and anticipation ahead of a launch. Whether teasing a new product line, preparing for a grand opening, or undergoing a rebrand, these pages effectively spark interest and [gather valuable leads](https://raffleleader.com/blog/ux-design-best-practices-for-lead-generation-in-2024/). Although coming soon pages can effectively advertise and promote your new brand; it's essential to consider certain factors when designing one to maximize its impact. In this article, we’ll define the purpose of a coming soon page, highlight its importance, and list 15 outstanding examples to inspire your own designs.

## **Why Do You Need a Coming Soon Page?**

A coming soon page, also known as a pre-launch page, is a landing page that generates anticipation and excitement for your upcoming brand, product, or website before it launches. By creating awareness, a coming soon landing page establishes your brand's presence, enhances engagement, and provides an early opportunity to build a list of potential customers. Publishing a coming soon page helps you:

### **To grab attention instantly**

Imagine this: you stumble upon a website and suddenly encounter a captivating coming soon landing page. It's like discovering an enticing movie trailer—immediately sparking curiosity and seizing your attention. A well-designed page teases visitors with just enough information to get them excited without giving everything away. 

### **To generate leads early**

A coming soon page is the perfect place to build your email list before your full website launches. By offering something valuable, like an exclusive sneak peek or a discount, you can get visitors to sign up and keep them in the loop about your launch.

### **To build brand awareness**

A coming soon landing page is your brand’s first impression, so make it count. It helps establish your brand’s presence early, giving you a head start in market recognition. Your visitors associate your brand with something new and exciting, creating buzz and anticipation.

### **To get a headstart on SEO**

Don’t underestimate the power of search engine optimization (SEO). A coming soon page allows you to build your ranking before your entire website is live. By optimizing content with keywords like “coming soon landing page,” you’re laying down the groundwork for better visibility when your site officially launches.

### **To keep the momentum alive**

Launching a new product or service involves lots of behind-the-scenes work. A coming soon page keeps the momentum going when you’re still in the development phase. It keeps you engaged with your audience, updates them on your progress, and fuels their excitement.

### **To get valuable feedback**

Feedback is gold, and a coming soon landing page is a great way to collect it. Encourage visitors to share their thoughts and suggestions about what they want to see. This input can be invaluable in perfecting your final product.

### **To create social proof**

People love to follow the crowd. Your coming soon page can create a sense of social proof by displaying the number of sign-ups or showcasing early testimonials. It’s like saying, “Look, others are excited about this; you should be too!”

### **To manage expectations**

Being transparent about your launch timeline builds trust. A coming soon page lets you set realistic expectations about when your offering will be available. This way, you manage visitor anticipation without causing frustration.
