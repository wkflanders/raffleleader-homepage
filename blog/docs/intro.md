## Raffle Leader is a WordPress plugin

Raffle Leader is a customizable giveaway plugin that seamlessly folds into any WordPress site. At its core, Raffle Leader is comprised of three parts:

### 1. Raffle Overview Page

This is Raffle Leader's admin panel and backend view. Here you can view all of your raffles as well as the contestants and entries for each individual raffle. Raffle Leader also provides tools for managing your raffles including contestant email export, duplicate raffle, and trash actions.

### 2. Raffle Builder Page

The builder page is where you can customize, edit, set start and end dates, write rules and terms, and publish each raffle. Choose from a variety of professionally crafted templates, or build your own from a blank canvas. Raffle Leader provides a multitude of tools for you to design your raffle exactly how you dream it.

## Can Raffle Leader work with non-WordPress sites?

At the moment, **no, Raffle Leader is strictly a WordPress plugin**. Raffle Leader relies on the WordPress environment for backend and database functions. There are plans to expand towards an independent web app that could work with any website however, so stay tuned!
